## 🎯 What This Is

This handbook is **not another React tutorial**. It's a comprehensive learning path designed to take you from beginner to job-ready frontend engineer, with the depth and rigor expected at top tech companies.

Built by Staff+ engineers who have:
- Built large-scale web platforms serving millions
- Interviewed hundreds of frontend candidates
- Designed bootcamps used by real companies

**Philosophy:**
- ✅ Production patterns over toy examples
- ✅ "Why" before "how"
- ✅ Real architecture decisions with tradeoffs
- ✅ Testing, performance, accessibility as first-class concerns
- ✅ Framework-aware, not framework-locked

## 🚀 Who This Is For

- **Bootcamp grads** ready to move beyond tutorials
- **Backend engineers** transitioning to frontend
- **Mid-level engineers** preparing for senior/staff roles
- **Self-taught developers** seeking structured depth
- **Interviewers** looking for comprehensive assessment material

## 📚 Learning Path

### [Beginner Bootcamp](beginner-bootcamp/)
Master the fundamentals that underpin all modern frontend work:
- **HTML/CSS**: Semantic markup, modern layout systems, responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Execution model, closures, async programming, the event loop
- **Browser APIs**: DOM manipulation, events, rendering pipeline
- **TypeScript**: Type systems, generics, utility types

**Time commitment**: 6-8 weeks (15 hours/week)

### [Intermediate Bootcamp](intermediate-bootcamp/)
Build production-ready applications with professional patterns:
1. **React Core**: Reconciliation, hooks internals, Suspense
2. **State Management**: Architecture patterns, server state, optimistic UI
3. **Component Architecture**: API design, composition, code splitting
4. **Performance**: Rendering optimization, bundle analysis, Web Vitals
5. **Testing**: Unit, integration, E2E, visual regression
6. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance, ARIA, keyboard navigation
7. **Networking**: REST/GraphQL, caching, real-time data
8. **System Design**: Scalability patterns, data flow architecture
9. **Build Tools**: Webpack, Vite, tree-shaking, module federation
10. **Security**: XSS/CSRF prevention, auth patterns, CSP
11. **Observability**: Error tracking, RUM, feature flags

**Time commitment**: 12-16 weeks (20 hours/week)

### [Advanced Topics](advanced-topics/)
Master cutting-edge patterns for scale:
- Micro-frontends architecture
- Design systems at scale
- React Server Components
- Edge computing & CDN strategies
- Organizational patterns for large teams

**Time commitment**: Self-paced

### [Real-World Projects](real-world-projects/)
Three production-grade applications with complete architecture:
1. **E-commerce Platform**: Product catalog, cart, checkout, payments
2. **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time data, virtualization, complex visualizations
3. **Design System Library**: Tokens, components, documentation, versioning

Each includes: architecture decisions, performance constraints, accessibility requirements, monitoring setup, and comprehensive tests.

## 🎤 Interview Preparation

Comprehensive prep covering:
- **Coding challenges**: JavaScript internals, React patterns, DOM manipulation
- **System design**: Framework, common questions, evaluation rubrics
- **Behavioral**: Leadership, technical decisions, conflict resolution
- **Company-specific**: FAANG, startups, common patterns

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

We use modern, industry-standard tools:

**Core:**
- React 18+ (Hooks, Suspense, Concurrent features)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Vite / Next.js

**State & Data:**
- React Query (TanStack Query)
- Zustand
- Context API

**Styling:**
- Modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid, Container Queries)
- CSS Modules / Tailwind

**Testing:**
- Jest + Testing Library
- Playwright (E2E)
- Chromatic (Visual regression)

**Tooling:**
- ESLint + Prettier
- GitHub Actions
- Lighthouse / Web Vitals

## 🗺️ How to Use This Handbook

1. **Start with the [Learning Roadmap](learning-roadmap.md)** to understand your current level
2. **Follow the bootcamp sequence** if you're learning comprehensively
3. **Jump to specific modules** if you need targeted knowledge
4. **Build the projects** to solidify understanding
5. **Use [Interview Prep](interview-prep/)** when preparing for roles

**Each module includes:**
- 📖 **Lecture**: Conceptual depth with diagrams and tradeoffs
- 🧪 **Lab**: Hands-on exercises with realistic scenarios
- 📝 **Homework**: Open-ended challenges (not copy-paste)
- ✅ **Tests**: Unit, integration, and E2E examples
