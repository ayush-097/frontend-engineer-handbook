# Intermediate Bootcamp Introduction

## What Makes This Bootcamp Different

This is **not a React tutorial**. By now, you should know React basics. This bootcamp is about:

- **Production patterns** used in real companies
- **Architecture decisions** and their tradeoffs
- **Quality engineering** (testing, performance, accessibility)
- **Systems thinking** for complex applications

## Who Should Take This

### You're Ready If:
- You've built basic React apps
- You understand hooks (useState, useEffect)
- You're comfortable with JavaScript
- You want to work at good companies

### You're Not Ready If:
- You struggle with JavaScript basics
- You haven't used React before
- You just want quick tutorials
- You're not willing to struggle

## The Curriculum Philosophy

### 1. Depth Over Breadth
We teach **fewer topics**, but **deeply**. You'll understand the "why" behind every pattern.

### 2. Production Mindset
Every module includes:
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Performance considerations
- Accessibility requirements
- Testing strategies

### 3. Real Tradeoffs
We don't just show "the right way." We explain:
- When to use each pattern
- What you gain and lose
- Alternative approaches
- Common mistakes

### 4. Interview Alignment
Content maps to what companies actually assess:
- Coding challenges (Modules 1-3)
- System design (Module 8)
- Performance (Module 4)
- Testing (Module 5)

## Expected Difficulty Curve

**Weeks 1-4:** Challenging but manageable  
**Weeks 5-8:** Hard. You'll struggle.  
**Weeks 9-12:** Clicking into place  
**Weeks 13-16:** Building confidence  

The struggle is the point. **Growth happens at the edge of ability.**

## Time Management

### Full-Time (40 hrs/week)
- **3-4 months** to complete
- 2 modules per week
- Daily practice
- Weekends for projects

### Part-Time (20 hrs/week)
- **6-8 months** to complete
- 1 module per week
- Weeknights for lectures/labs
- Weekends for homework

### Accelerated (60 hrs/week)
- **2-3 months** to complete
- Focus mode, no distractions
- Multiple modules per week
- High intensity, high reward

## How to Succeed

### Study Habits
- **Code before reading solutions**
- **Debug systematically** (not randomly)
- **Take notes in code comments**
- **Review weekly** (spaced repetition)
- **Teach others** (best way to learn)

### When You're Stuck
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check the documentation
3. Use the debugger (not console.log)
4. Search for similar issues
5. Ask specific questions in community

### Warning Signs
If you're:
- Copying code without understanding
- Skipping tests
- Not reading error messages
- Rushing through modules

**Stop. Slow down. Go deeper.**

## Building Your Portfolio

Throughout this bootcamp, build:
1. **E-commerce app** (Modules 1-4)
2. **Dashboard** (Modules 5-8)
3. **Component library** (Modules 9-11)

These become your portfolio pieces.

## Assessment Approach

We don't have "pass/fail." Instead:

**Green (Ready to advance):**
- Completed all labs
- Homework shows deep understanding
- Can explain tradeoffs
- Tests pass

**Yellow (Need review):**
- Labs incomplete
- Shallow understanding
- Struggled with concepts
- Review before advancing

**Red (Not ready):**
- Skipped fundamentals
- No hands-on practice
- Can't debug issues
- Go back to Beginner Bootcamp

Be honest with yourself. **Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.**

## Mental Models

### The Three Levels of Understanding

**Level 1 - Syntax**: You can write the code  
**Level 2 - Semantics**: You understand what it does  
**Level 3 - Pragmatics**: You know when to use it  

Aim for Level 3 on everything.

### The Learning Loop

```
Build → Break → Debug → Understand → Build Better
```

Embrace this cycle. Breaking things is learning.

## Community & Support

- **Discord**: Daily discussions
- **GitHub Issues**: Questions/bugs
- **Office Hours**: Weekly (recorded)
- **Study Groups**: Find peers

Learning alone is hard. **Find your tribe.**
