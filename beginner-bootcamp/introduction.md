# Introduction to Beginner Bootcamp

## Why These Topics Matter

You might be eager to jump into React, but **frameworks are built on fundamentals**. Without solid JavaScript knowledge, you'll struggle to:
- Debug complex issues
- Understand what React is actually doing
- Make informed architecture decisions
- Pass technical interviews

## Learning Philosophy

This bootcamp follows these principles:

### 1. Depth Over Breadth
We'd rather you **deeply understand** 10 concepts than superficially know 100.

### 2. First Principles
We explain **why things work the way they do**, not just how to use them.

### 3. Hands-On Practice
You'll spend more time coding than reading. **Build to learn.**

### 4. Production Mindset
Even at this level, we teach patterns used in real companies.

## How to Succeed

### Do:
✅ Code along with every example  
✅ Struggle before looking at solutions  
✅ Ask "why" constantly  
✅ Break things intentionally  
✅ Review regularly  

### Don't:
❌ Skip the fundamentals  
❌ Copy/paste without understanding  
❌ Rush through to finish quickly  
❌ Ignore error messages  
❌ Work in isolation (join communities!)  

## Expected Challenges

**Week 1-2:** "This is easier than I thought"  
**Week 3-4:** "Wait, this is actually hard"  
**Week 5-6:** "I'm starting to get it"  
**Week 7-8:** "I can build things!"  

The difficulty curve is intentional. Embrace the struggle.

## Time Management

### Full-Time (40 hrs/week)
- **6-8 weeks** to complete
- 2-3 lectures per day
- 1-2 labs per day
- Review on weekends

### Part-Time (10 hrs/week)
- **16-20 weeks** to complete
- 1 lecture per weeknight (1 hr)
- Labs on weekends (5 hrs)
- Homework as you go

## Getting Help

Stuck? Here's the protocol:
1. **Read error message carefully**
2. **Search MDN** for the concept
3. **Debug systematically** (console.log is your friend)
4. **Ask in community** (see [communities.md](../communities.md))

## Measuring Progress

Track your confidence (1-10) weekly on:
- HTML/CSS layout systems
- JavaScript execution model
- Async programming
- Browser APIs
- TypeScript type system

If any score is <7, review that module.
